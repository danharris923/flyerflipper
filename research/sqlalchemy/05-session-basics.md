# SQLAlchemy Session Management

Here's a comprehensive overview of SQLAlchemy Session management based on the documentation:

## Key Session Lifecycle Principles

### 1. Session Basics
- Represents a "holding zone" for database objects
- Maintains an identity map of unique objects
- Manages database transactions and connections

### 2. Session Scope and Best Practices
- Create a session at the beginning of a logical database operation
- Manage session lifecycle externally to data-specific functions
- Use context managers to handle session opening/closing
- Commit or rollback transactions as appropriate

### 3. Transaction Handling
- Sessions automatically begin a transaction when first used
- Use `session.begin()` to explicitly start a transaction
- Call `session.commit()` to save changes
- Use `session.rollback()` to revert changes

### 4. Concurrency Considerations
- Sessions are **not thread-safe**
- Each thread/task should have its own session
- Use context managers to ensure proper session management

### 5. Session Creation Patterns
```python
# Recommended approach
with Session(engine) as session:
    with session.begin():
        # Perform database operations
        session.add(some_object)
```

### 6. Key Methods
- `session.add()`: Add new objects
- `session.delete()`: Mark objects for deletion
- `session.flush()`: Synchronize session state with database
- `session.commit()`: Save transaction
- `session.rollback()`: Revert transaction
- `session.close()`: Reset session state

## Recommended Practices
- Create a `sessionmaker` once at application startup
- Limit session scope to specific operations
- Handle transactions explicitly
- Use context managers for session management
- Avoid sharing sessions across threads/tasks
