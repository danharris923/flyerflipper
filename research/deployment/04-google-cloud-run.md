# Google Cloud Run Deployment

## Platform Overview
Google Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that enables running stateless containers in a serverless environment.

## Key Features
- Automatic scaling to zero
- Pay-per-use billing model
- Supports any language or framework that can run in a container
- Built-in load balancing
- HTTPS endpoints out of the box
- Integration with Google Cloud services

## Container Requirements
- Container must listen on the port defined by the PORT environment variable
- Container must be stateless
- Container must handle HTTP requests
- Must respond to health checks

## Deployment Process
1. Build container image
2. Push to Container Registry or Artifact Registry
3. Deploy to Cloud Run service
4. Configure service settings (memory, CPU, scaling)

## Environment Configuration
- Environment variables through Cloud Run service configuration
- Secrets management through Google Secret Manager
- Service account authentication for Google Cloud services

## For FastAPI + React Applications
- Deploy backend and frontend as separate Cloud Run services
- Use Cloud Load Balancer for routing
- Leverage Cloud CDN for static assets
- Implement proper CORS configuration

## Scaling and Performance
- Automatic scaling based on incoming requests
- Cold start optimization for containerized applications
- Regional deployment for reduced latency
- Traffic splitting for gradual deployments
