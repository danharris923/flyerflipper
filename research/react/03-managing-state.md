# Managing State in React

## Key State Management Principles

### 1. State Organization
- Avoid redundant or duplicate state
- State should be intentionally structured to minimize bugs
- Calculate derived values during rendering when possible

### 2. State Interaction Patterns
- Describe UI states instead of direct modifications
- Use state to represent different visual component conditions
- Enable/disable UI elements through state variables

### 3. State Sharing Techniques
- "Lift state up" to closest common parent component
- Pass state via props to child components
- Use different strategies for complex state management

## Advanced State Management Approaches

### 1. Reducers
- Consolidate state update logic in a single function
- Simplify event handlers by defining user "actions"
- Manage complex state transitions systematically

### 2. Context
- Pass data deeply through component tree
- Avoid prop drilling
- Make information available without explicit prop passing

## Best Practices
- Use `useState` for simple state
- Implement `useReducer` for complex state logic
- Leverage context for cross-component data sharing
- Reset component state using unique `key` props
- Calculate derived state during rendering when possible

The documentation emphasizes creating maintainable, predictable state management strategies that scale with application complexity.
