## Key Takeaways

### Multi-Stage Dockerfile Pattern
Recommended for FastAPI + React applications:
1. Build stage for dependencies
2. Production stage with minimal footprint
3. Separate containers for backend/frontend

### Environment Management
- Use Docker Compose for local development
- Environment variables through .env files
- Separate configurations for dev/staging/production

### Production Best Practices
- Pin base image versions
- Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
- Implement health checks
- Single process per container
- External load balancing and HTTPS termination
