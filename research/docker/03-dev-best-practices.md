# Docker Development Best Practices

## Multi-Stage Builds
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce final image size
- Create reusable stages to improve build efficiency
- Split Dockerfile instructions into distinct stages

## Base Image Selection
- Choose trusted, official images from:
  - Docker Official Images
  - Verified Publisher images
  - Docker-Sponsored Open Source images
- Select minimal base images that match requirements
- Consider separate images for building and production

## Image Management
- Rebuild images frequently to get latest dependencies
- Use `--no-cache` to ensure fresh downloads
- Pin base image versions for supply chain integrity
- Exclude unnecessary files with `.dockerignore`

## Container Design Principles
- Create ephemeral containers
- Avoid installing unnecessary packages
- Decouple applications (one container, one concern)
- Limit containers to minimal processes

## Dockerfile Best Practices
- Sort multi-line arguments alphanumerically
- Leverage build cache
- Use `RUN` instructions efficiently
- Clean up package managers to reduce image size
- Use environment variables for version management

## Security and Maintenance
- Build and test images in continuous integration
- Use current official images
- Add meaningful labels
- Carefully manage environment variables

## Key Recommendations
- Create lean, secure, and maintainable Docker images
- Focus on thoughtful design and best practices
- Optimize for both development and production environments
