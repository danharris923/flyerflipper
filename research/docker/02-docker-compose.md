# Docker Compose

## Overview
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It enables managing entire application stacks through a single YAML configuration file and works across environments: production, staging, development, testing, and CI workflows.

## Core Capabilities
- Create and start services with a single command
- Manage services, networks, and volumes
- Perform lifecycle operations like:
  - Start, stop, and rebuild services
  - View service status
  - Stream service log output
  - Run one-off commands on services

## Key Benefits
- Streamlines development and deployment experience
- Simplifies complex application infrastructure management
- Provides consistent configuration across different environments

## Recommended Implementation Steps
1. Install Docker Compose
2. Review the Compose file reference
3. Explore the quickstart guide
4. Understand how Compose works through documentation

## Use Cases
- Multi-container applications (FastAPI backend + React frontend)
- Development environment consistency
- Staging and production deployment
- CI/CD pipeline integration

Docker Compose is critical for developers seeking to simplify multi-container application management, offering flexibility and ease of use across various development scenarios.
