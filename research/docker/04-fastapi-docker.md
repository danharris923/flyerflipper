# FastAPI Docker Deployment

## Container Basics
- Containers are "lightweight" ways to package applications with dependencies
- Containers run on the same Linux kernel as the host system
- Each container has isolated processes, file system, and network

## Dockerfile Best Practices for FastAPI
- Start with an official Python base image
- Use a multi-step approach to optimize build caching
- Copy requirements file first to leverage Docker's build cache
- Install dependencies before copying application code
- Use exec form for CMD instruction

## Sample Dockerfile Structure
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /code
COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r requirements.txt
COPY ./app /code/app
CMD ["fastapi", "run", "app/main.py", "--port", "80"]
```

## Deployment Strategies
- Single process per container recommended
- Use load balancers for request distribution
- Handle HTTPS externally (e.g., Traefik)
- Kubernetes/cluster systems manage replication

## Deployment Options
- Docker Compose
- Kubernetes clusters
- Cloud container services
- Docker Swarm Mode

## Key Recommendations
- Avoid deprecated base images
- Build images from scratch
- Use `--workers` for specific multi-process scenarios
- Leverage container management tools for scaling and resilience

## Multi-Container Setup
For FastAPI + React applications:
- Separate containers for backend and frontend
- Use Docker Compose to orchestrate services
- Configure proper networking between containers
- Handle environment variables appropriately
