# Reebee API Research Overview

## Summary
After comprehensive research, Reebee does not provide a public API for developers. The company operates through direct partnerships with retailers who supply data and pay based on user views.

## Key Findings

### Reebee Business Model
- Reebee works through B2B partnerships with retailers
- Retailers supply flyer data directly to Reebee
- Revenue model based on flyer view counts
- No web scraping - data comes from direct retailer partnerships

### API Availability
- **No public API documentation found**
- **No developer integration resources**
- **No official API endpoints discovered**
- Recent app migration (July 2023) by Flipp Operations Inc.

### Alternative Solutions
Since Reebee doesn't offer public API access, alternative approaches include:

1. **Direct retailer APIs** (when available)
2. **Flipp.com scraping** (more accessible alternative)
3. **Individual grocery store scraping**
4. **Third-party grocery data services**

## Recommendations

For a Canadian grocery flyer application, consider:

1. **Use Flipp.com as primary data source** - has discoverable API endpoints
2. **Implement direct grocery store scraping** for major Canadian chains
3. **Contact Reebee directly** for potential business partnership opportunities
4. **Build hybrid approach** combining multiple data sources

## Technical Implications

- Cannot rely on Reebee as data source
- Must implement alternative scraping strategies
- Consider rate limiting and ethical scraping practices
- May need to aggregate data from multiple sources
