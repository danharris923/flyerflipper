# Reebee API Research Summary

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive research on Reebee API and Canadian grocery store data scraping alternatives. Since Reebee does not offer a public API, alternative approaches have been documented for accessing Canadian grocery flyer data.

## Key Findings

### Reebee Business Model
- **No Public API Available**: Reebee operates through direct partnerships with retailers
- **B2B Revenue Model**: Retailers supply data and pay based on flyer view counts  
- **No Web Scraping**: Data comes from direct retailer relationships, not scraping
- **Recent Changes**: App migration completed July 2023 by Flipp Operations Inc.

### Alternative Data Sources

#### 1. Flipp.com (Recommended Primary Source)
- **Discoverable API endpoints** for Canadian grocery data
- **Unofficial but accessible** API at `https://backflipp.wishabi.com/flipp`
- **Comprehensive store coverage** including major Canadian chains
- **Postal code-based** location filtering
- **JSON response format** with detailed product information

#### 2. Direct Grocery Store Scraping
- **Major Canadian chains** have individual websites that can be scraped
- **Selenium-based approach** recommended due to JavaScript-heavy sites
- **Location-aware pricing** based on postal codes
- **grocery-helpers library** available for common Canadian stores

#### 3. Third-party Services
- **Commercial scraping services** available for Loblaws, Metro, etc.
- **Professional APIs** offered by companies like RetailGators and Actowiz

## Implementation Approaches

### Recommended Strategy
1. **Primary**: Use Flipp.com API for broad coverage
2. **Secondary**: Direct scraping of major chains for specific data
3. **Fallback**: Commercial services for critical missing data

### Technical Requirements
- **Python with Selenium** for JavaScript-heavy sites
- **Requests library** for API calls
- **Rate limiting** (2-5 seconds between requests)
- **Error handling** and retry logic
- **Data cleaning** and normalization
- **Legal compliance** with terms of service

## Quick Start

### Flipp API Usage
```python
from flipp_api import FlippAPI

api = FlippAPI(rate_limit_delay=2.0)
deals = api.search_by_product("milk", "M5V3A8")  # Toronto postal code

for deal in deals:
    print(f"{deal.name} at {deal.merchant}: ${deal.price}")
```

### Selenium Scraping
```python
from canadian_grocery_scraper import CanadianGroceryScraper

scraper = CanadianGroceryScraper(headless=True)
loblaws_deals = scraper.scrape_loblaws_deals("M5V3A8")
scraper.close()
```

## Legal Considerations

- **Always check robots.txt** before scraping
- **Respect terms of service** of each website
- **Implement rate limiting** to avoid server overload
- **Consider PIPEDA compliance** for Canadian privacy laws
- **Use data ethically** and transparently

## Supported Canadian Grocery Stores

### Via Flipp API
- Walmart Canada
- Real Canadian Superstore
- Loblaws
- Metro
- Sobeys
- No Frills
- Save-On-Foods
- And 20+ other major chains

### Via Direct Scraping
- **Loblaws Group**: Loblaws, Real Canadian Superstore, No Frills, Zehrs
- **Metro Inc.**: Metro, Food Basics  
- **Sobeys**: Sobeys, Safeway, FreshCo, IGA
- **Walmart Canada**

## Data Available

- Product names and descriptions
- Regular and sale prices
- Discount percentages
- Brand information
- Product images
- Flyer validity dates
- Store locations
- Product categories

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Start with Flipp API** for rapid prototyping
2. **Add direct scraping** for stores with unique offerings
3. **Implement robust error handling** and monitoring
4. **Set up data processing pipeline** for normalization
5. **Create user-friendly interface** for grocery deal discovery

## Maintenance Considerations

- **Monitor API changes** - Flipp endpoints could change
- **Update scraping selectors** - Store websites change frequently  
- **Rotate user agents** and IP addresses to avoid blocking
- **Regular testing** of all data sources
- **Legal review** of terms of service changes

This research provides a solid foundation for building a Canadian grocery flyer application without relying on unavailable Reebee API access.
